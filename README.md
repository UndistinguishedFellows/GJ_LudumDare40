Thanks for playing our game.
You are a sneaky thief that is trying to steal the three main gems of the museum. Avoid the guards with your habilities and your intelligence.

Habilities use energy and for every gem you picked the slower you will move and more energy you will consume.

Controls:

- F: Interact. Steal the museums treasures. Finish the level.
- Right mouse click. Use the active hability.
 - Mouse wheel: Change the active hability.
 - LCtrl: Crouch. Move slower.
